# Machine Learning 2 – Final Project

## 🚗 Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent vehicle insurance claims using machine learning techniques. Fraud detection is a critical task for insurance companies, helping reduce financial losses and improve claim processing efficiency.

### 👥 Project Team
- **Andrei Bysik**
- **Mihail Slijov**

### 🧠 Methodology
We evaluate and compare multiple machine learning models for fraud detection:

**Baseline Models**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

**Advanced Models**
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

The performance of baseline models is compared against advanced classifiers to assess improvements in accuracy and overall predictive capability.

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:
